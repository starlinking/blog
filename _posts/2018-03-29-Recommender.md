## Introduction

Many machine learning algorithms, including some used in recommender engines, require two phases in order to be effective.
1. A Training Phase:
  All data about all customerâ€™s preferences are combined, and the algorithm creates a model of how it views the world. This may include groupings of what customers are similar to each other, or just internal data structures it can use to quickly generate a prediction later. 
2. A Query Phase:
  The training phase often requires a lot of time and memory, whereas the query phase is generally pretty fast.

### General Techniques

There are three techniques used generally in recommender engines
* Market Basket Analysis (MBA)
* Collaborative Filtering (CF) 	--- ML, supervised learning
  * user based
  * item based
  * content based
* K-Means Clustering (KMC) 		--- ML, unsupervised learning


## Programming Experience

Let us use Python for this project!
