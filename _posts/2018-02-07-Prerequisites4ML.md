# Prerequisites

In general, it would be very helpful to speed up your exploration if you have good bases at programming experience, basic linear algebra, statistics and probability to start learning ML.

## Programming Experience

Machine learning and data analysis are fundamentally iterative processes, in which the data drive the analysis. It is essential for these process to have programs and tools that allow quick iteration and easy interaction.

### Why Python?

* Learning curve to get through Python with the basics < 2 months 
* Using Python is the ability to interact directly with the code.
* Python has libraries for data loading, visualization, statistics, natural language processing, image processing, and more.
* It allows for the creation of complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and web services, and for integration into existing systems.

## Math Background 

Having a solid Math background is very important for any starter in ML or AI. One needs to be pretty good in identifying distributions and deal with them.

Do not panic if you do not have one. Just take the online related courses would be sufficient.

### Basic Linear Algebra

```bash
###

```

### Statistics
